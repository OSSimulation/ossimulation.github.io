# 1. Getting Started

Hello! If you're reading this, welcome to the Windows XP Gui Test manual!
While this manual may no longer be useful due to the fact the game has
now been taken down, I hope this can find some use for you.

NOTE: The following text below expects you to have already re-uploaded the
game to your Roblox account, or you are using the simulator in Roblox Studio.

To start Windows XP Gui Test, simply launch the place from your Roblox app,
the Roblox website, or press Play in Roblox Studio.

Once you do that, you will be greeted by the boot screen. The game will wait
for assets to finish pre-loading, and then show a loading bar.

point out what the action does below.

This may take a few seconds, so be patient. Once that's done,
you will be greeted with the Desktop.
